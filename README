Code isn't fully functional. Got linked list set up and read-in but have been struggling a bit mentally lately and have not finished.
Plan was to have the code use a function to read each instruction as it's fed in, then use one of the functions listed for each potential input. At that point it would call 
the various fit types to perform necessary operations.
